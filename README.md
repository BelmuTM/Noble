## Releases

The project is in constant evolution. Therefore, you can expect bug fixes, new features, and
occasional issues along the way.


Noble will always remain **free and open source**. I started this project to learn computer graphics
and have fun, I do not want to monetize it.  
You can still access paid, more engineered versions of Noble on my [Patreon page](https://patreon.com/Belmu).

I've poured hundreds of hours, many sleepless nights, and a lot of coffee into this project. I deeply
hope you enjoy the result!
