# NobleRT
Noble is a Minecraft shaderpack that enhances one's experience with the help of good-looking graphics and light simulations.
It offers a handful of customizable options to tweak according to your desires. 
**VERSIONS ABOVE 1.16 ARE HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.**

## Releases
The project is in constant evolution. Therefore, you can expect some issues to be fixed,
some features to be added, and some problems to appear. However, it will remain free and
open source forever, as I don't want to monetize my learning of GLSL. Exclusive versions are most
likely to be exclusive to Patreon supporters or close friends, but they will always end up
being accessible to public no matter what.

## License
NobleRT is licensed under the GPL v3.0 License. Please consider reading the terms before modifying / distributing this project.
