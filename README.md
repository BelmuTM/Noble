## About Noble
Noble is a Minecraft shaderpack that enhances one's experience with the help of good-looking graphics and light simulations.
It offers a handful of customizable options to tweak according to your desires. 

## Releases
The project is in constant evolution. Therefore, you can expect some issues to be fixed,
some features to be added, and some problems to appear. However, it will remain free and
open source forever, as I don't want to monetize my learning of GLSL. Exclusive versions are most
likely to be exclusive to Patreon supporters or close friends, but they will always end up
being accessible to public no matter what.

## Requirements
* **Optifine / Iris for 1.16 or newer** (older versions aren't supported)
* A Nvidia graphics card (GTX 950 or newer) **OR**  an AMD graphics card (R7 370 or newer)
* **If you have an AMD card** → make sure your drivers version is **22.5.1** or lower
* Windows or Linux (MacOS isn't supported)
* ⚠️ **MAKE SURE TO UNZIP THE FILE FIRST**
