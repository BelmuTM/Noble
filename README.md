Noble RT is a Minecraft shaderpack that enhances one's experience with the help of good-looking graphics and light simulations.
It offers a handful of customizable options to tweak according to your desires. **Most versions should properly work as long as Optifine is being used.**

## Install
### Releases
The project is in constant evolution. Therefore, you can expect some issues to be fixed,
some features to be added, and some problems to appear. However, it will remain free and
open source forever, as I don't want to monetize my learning of GLSL. Beta versions are most
likely to be exclusive to Patreon supporters or close friends, but they will always end up
being accessible to public no matter what.

### Tutorial
   1. Join the Discord server. ([Click me!](https://discord.gg/jjRrhpkH9e))
   2. Click the *#releases* channel.
   3. Download the desired release.
   5. Drag it in your "shaderpacks" folder.
      * Hold Windows + R.
      * Type %appdata% in the window.
      * Drag the shaderpack in */Roaming/.minecraft/shaderpacks/*
   6. Enjoy!
